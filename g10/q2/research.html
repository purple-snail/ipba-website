                        <p>
                            The study explores the complex relationship between gaming and academic performance in APEC Kalumpang junior high students, identifying both positive and negative effects such as enhanced cognitive skills and social interaction versus academic distraction and potential addiction. The importance of moderation in gaming is emphasized, supported by a survey of 50 students. A previous study suggests gaming can positively impact educational outcomes when balanced with study time. However, concerns are raised about lower motivation, social network addiction, and physical and psychological harm associated with excessive gaming. The study advocates for understanding individual motivations and implementing interventions to support a healthy balance between gaming and academics. It aims to investigate the prevalence of gaming, the correlation between gaming time and academic performance, and the relationship between the types of games played and academic outcomes. The goal is to provide valuable insights into fostering a balanced and supportive educational environment amid the growing popularity of video games.  The findings will give students insights to prevent negative effects, help parents understand and support their child's academic journey, and offer valuable information for other researchers in related studies.

                        <p>"The Effects of Gaming on the Academic Performance of Junior High School Students of Apec Schools Kalumpang" The allure of video games is undeniable, offering immersive experiences and interactive challenges that captivate the minds of adolescents. However, there is a growing debate over whether the time and energy spent on gaming might be diverting students' attention and resources away from their educational responsibilities.
