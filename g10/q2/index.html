                                According to (Basrizal 2023), overindulgence in gaming may hurt academic performance. Studies show that learners who spend much time playing slots tend to perform below average in school. Gaming addiction results in a lack of motivation and ineffective time management. These cases have an impact on academic achievement.

                                Based on the survey that we conducted in the Junior high school, the attitude of some individuals may hold the belief that gaming has a negative impact on academic performance due to potential time distraction, while others may have a more neutral stance, seeing gaming as a form of entertainment that can be managed responsibly.
