                What were the first civilizations? How does it form and how does it affect us today?<br><br>
                Did you know? Ancient Egypt Civilizations was one of the oldest and one of the earliest civilizations in world history. It was known for its amazing achievements of the civilization involving innovations in writing, hieroglyphics, and demotic: in administration, in quarrying and surveying, maths and architecture, in irrigation and agricultural methods, as well as in developing some of the earliest ships. The Ancient Egyptian civilization also produced the first government to rule an entire nation.

                Egypt is located in the Nile Valley, in the North East of Africa.<br><br>
                The life of Ancient Egypt centered around the river Nile and the fertile land along its banks. 
                The ancient Egyptians worshipped many gods and goddesses. 
                One of the gods that the Egyptians worshipped is the  Pharaoh, the Pharaoh was the ruler of Ancient Egypt, both politically and religiously, and held the title ‘Lord of the Two Lands’, meaning that he ruled all of Upper and Lower Egypt, and ‘High Priest of Every Temple’, meaning that he represented all the gods on all the Earth.

            <h1>Gender Issues</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                Married Egyptian women were expected(by the husband’s family) to bear children, particularly males, and expect them to bear at least 2 male children and try again if they birth a female as again females were viewed to be inferior to men. If the mother fails to bear male children they will be mocked and called derogatory names on the other hand if the woman bears healthy, well-grown male children they would be thought as powerful as the mother gains control over the newly growing family of her sons this is proof that ancient egyptians thought that bearing female children are thought to be a failed family. Nowadays a lot of women are breadwinners for their families and often have higher positions than just being a simple housewife.<br><br>
                Even though men and women had the same legal rights, women were still treated unequally and were not allowed to have certain jobs. Because of this, it reduced the job opportunities of women. But this problem didn't just affect them, this problem still affects us today because this problem still exists today.<br><br>

                This is a problem and because it’s a problem, there has to have some sort of cause to this problem. We have some causes in mind on why this is happening.<br><br>
                Some of the causes are:<br>
                Women are thought to be weaker than men<br>
                Women prioritizing their gender role and doing unpaid household instead<br>
                Men being more valued than women<br>
                Pressure from their society and their gender role<br>
                Women pressured to have children<br>
                Men doing more work than women as they are expected to provide<br>
                Gender Stereotyping forcing people to conform to their gender role<br>
                Women getting fewer job opportunities

            <h1>Impact of gender inequality in jobs in ancient egypt</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                The impact of the problem then was that it reduced the job opportunities of women and it made women follow their gender role even more. This meant that more men are employed than women and women will face challenges in finding employment.  This also decreased the number of female rulers in egypt since women were not allowed to have important roles in administration.

            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                Now let’s talk about the impact of the problem in the present day. Even though that we have made great strides, we still haven’t fixed this problem yet. Women still face challenges in finding employment and women still give their gender role a priority. But there are some changes like women being allowed to have administrative roles. The other impacts are that gender inequality can affect one’s mental health and can affect economic growth since women can be almost half of the entire workforce. It can also low one’s self-esteem and confidence and can even affect relationships.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                In ancient Egypt women's roles were worked around the house cleaning, preparing food and making clothes, and more. Though not all women in ancient egypt do those roles, women used to owned businesses or own property some work as entertainers and musicians, and all though they had fewer opportunities than men they still have the same legal rights even a woman can be a pharaoh in certain situations, though when humanity grew the gender issues got worse as it became harder for women to look for a job than in ancient times having the gender inequality will not only affect the jobs of people it can affect relationships, behavior and even cause depression.
